What is Scratch

Scratch is a free object-oriented software development kit (SDK) that allows children age 8-16 to create animations, interactive stories, games and music without needing to know a specific programming language. Scratch, which consists of a script, paint and sound editor, is maintained by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab and features an online community to encourage collaboration among young programmers.

Pong is a game where a paddle is used to hit a ball and bounce it off a wall, allowing it to return towards the paddle. The paddle is on a single axis of movement, parallel to the wall, and must intercept the ball on its return path to keep the game from ending. The ball continues to bounce until this happens.
