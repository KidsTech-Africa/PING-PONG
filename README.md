# PING-PONG

Pong is a game where a paddle is used to hit a ball and bounce it off a wall, allowing it to return towards the paddle. The paddle is on a single axis of movement, parallel to the wall, and must intercept the ball on its return path to keep the game from ending. The ball continues to bounce until this happens.
